# BlueShield-USV
**Smart Water Surface Drone for Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring & Heavy Metal Prediction**

BlueShield is an interdisciplinary final year project focused on addressing the growing problem of freshwater contamination, especially due to **heavy metals** like **arsenic, barium, and lithium**. This project combines **embedded systems, IoT, full stack and machine learning** to build a fully functional **water surface drone** capable of monitoring water quality in real-time and predicting heavy metal concentrations.
